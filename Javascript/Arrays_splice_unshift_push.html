<!-- The triple commas after `true` in the line `Array:Khushal,true,,,Cena` are not
actually printed. They are placeholders for `null` and `undefined` in the array.
In JavaScript, when you print an array that contains `null` or `undefined`
elements, they are represented as `null` or `undefined` respectively. However,
when you print the array as a string, `null` and `undefined` are represented as
empty strings. So, the array `["Khushal", true, null, undefined, "Cena"]` is
printed as `Array:Khushal,true,,,Cena` because `null` and `undefined` are
represented as empty strings in the string representation of the array. -->
